# Dimensionality Reduction
In Part 3 i.e. Classification we worked with datasets composed of only two independent variables.<br>
We did this for two reasons : <br>
1. Because we needed two dimensions to visualize better how Machine Learning models worked (by plotting the prediction regions and the prediction boundary for each model).
2. Because whatever is the original number of our independent variables, we can often end up with two independent variables by applying an appropriate Dimensionality Reduction technique.<br>

There are two types of Dimensionality Reduction techniques:<br>
1. Feature Selection
2. Feature Extraction
<br>
Feature Selection techniques are Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, Bidirectional Elimination, Score Comparison and more.
